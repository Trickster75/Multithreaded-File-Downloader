# Multithreaded-File-Downloader
This Java program is a **Multithreaded File Downloader with a JavaFX GUI**, designed to allow users to download multiple files from the internet simultaneously through a user-friendly interface. Each file download runs in a separate thread using Java's concurrency framework, ensuring that the UI remains responsive. The application provides real-time updates on download progress, speed, and estimated time remaining using observable properties and progress bars. Users can pause, resume, or cancel downloads, and each download is neatly displayed in its own panel within a scrollable view. The program efficiently handles network and file I/O operations, making it a practical example of combining JavaFX, multithreading, and network programming in a modern desktop application.
